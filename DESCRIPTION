Description: This package uses an LLM to inspect existing package test
    code and write new code to bring test coverage to 100%. This is
    particularly useful for packages that contain compiled code, to ensure
    that all code paths are hit and diagnostic tools such as Valgrind,
    ASAN/UBSAN give more reliable results.
